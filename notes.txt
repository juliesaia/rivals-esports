cp floating-ui.dom.umd.js /home/cheesypotato/rivals-esports/.output/server/node_modules/@floating-ui/dom/dist/floating-ui.dom.umd.js
cp floating-ui.core.umd.js /home/cheesypotato/rivals-esports/.output/server/node_modules/@floating-ui/core/dist/floating-ui.core.umd.js

make standings table rows a dropdown with all sets?
