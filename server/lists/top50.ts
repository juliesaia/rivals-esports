Coming into the top 8 from winners's side certainly gave him an advantage though he had a bit of a scare narrowly beating Arcanine in game 5 of their set. After that, the rest is history as he cleaned up MrLz 3 - 0 to take the trophy and the title of the first RCS Champion. FullStream doesn't plan on stopping anytime soon either.
